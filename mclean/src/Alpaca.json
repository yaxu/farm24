  {"id":"andersonImagerySpatialRepresentation2017","abstract":"Take a moment to use mental imagery to perform the following tasks: (1) decide whether an apple is more similar in shape to a banana or an orange, (2) determine how to rearrange the furniture in your bedroom to make room for a new dresser, and (3) drive home during rush hour. Although we take our ability to perform tasks such as these for granted, they raise a host of interesting questions about imagery. For instance, what is the relationship between imagery and perception? What types of processes are needed to account for our ability to generate, maintain, transform, and inspect images? How do we characterize individual differences in imagery ability? What is the relation between imagery and spatial representation? What can we do with mental imagery? This essay will focus on visual imagery, because we know more about visual imagery than auditory, haptic, gustatory, or olfactory imagery. The expectation is that many principles, although not all details, of emerging theory will be applicable to imagery in other modes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Rita E."}],"citation-key":"andersonImagerySpatialRepresentation2017","container-title":"A Companion to Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1002/9781405164535.ch12","ISBN":"978-1-4051-6453-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"204-211","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"12","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Imagery and Spatial Representation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781405164535.ch12"},

When the task was to create one recognizable pattern from three simple shapes in a 2-min assembly period, subjects were as likely to produce a recognizable or creative pattern per trial whether mental imagery was augmented by external drawing support or not. When the task was to create as many patterns as possible in a 3-min assembly period, more patterns were produced per trial with external drawing support than without; however, neither the recognizability nor the creativity of the patterns differed.

  {"id":"ballSelfMadeTapestryPattern2001","abstract":"For centuries, scientists have struggled to understand the origins of the patterns and forms found in nature. Now, in this lucid and accessibly written book, Philip Ball applies state-of-the-art scientific understanding from the fields of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and mathematics to these ancient mysteries, revealing how nature's seemingly complex patterns originate in simple physical laws. Tracing the history of scientific thought about natural patterns, Ball shows how common presumptions--for example, that complex form must be guided by some intelligence or that form always follows function--are erroneous and continue to mislead scientists today. He investigates specific patterns in depth, revealing that these designs are self-organized and that simple, local interactions between component parts produce motifs like spots, stripes, branches, and honeycombs.

  {"id":"ballSelfMadeTapestryPattern2001a","abstract":"For centuries, scientists have struggled to understand the origins of the patterns and forms found in nature. Now, in this lucid and accessibly written book, Philip Ball applies state-of-the-art scientific understanding from the fields of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and mathematics to these ancient mysteries, revealing how nature's seemingly complex patterns originate in simple physical laws. Tracing the history of scientific thought about natural patterns, Ball shows how common presumptions–for example, that complex form must be guided by some intelligence or that form always follows function–are erroneous and continue to mislead scientists today. He investigates specific patterns in depth, revealing that these designs are self-organized and that simple, local interactions between component parts produce motifs like spots, stripes, branches, and honeycombs. In the process, he examines the mysterious phenomenon of symmetry and why it appears–and breaks–in similar ways in different systems. Finally, he attempts to answer this profound question: why are some patterns universal?

  {"id":"brionesLiveCodingTheatre2022","abstract":"Introduction‘Live coding’ has become a performative artistic practice that lies at the intersection of programming and artistic creation, often with an emphasis on music. Typically, live coding performances are presented on a stage, upon which there is a (personal) computer and a human producing code in one of a number of programming languages in real time. The screen of the performer is usually projected so that the audience can see the edits of code being produced. Sometimes, this code may be interpretable by the audience:sound “kick kick clap kick”As part of this, the audience thus witnesses the computer following the code/instructions, such as by producing an audio signal; in the example above, a musical pattern of three kick drums and a classic handclap sample. The visual cue provided by the code is important. Since the audience see on the screen that the clap falls on the third beat, they may try to adjust their cognition to ‘perceive’ the clap as the third beat of a 4/4 bar.As our performance continues, with this programme running in a loop, the performer edits the code:sound “kick kick clap*2 kick?”Now the audience hears two kicks and two faster claps, sometimes followed by a rest and at other times by a kick (the ‘sometimes’ induced by the inclusion of the ‘?’). The performer keeps editing the code and the music continues to change until either the computer crashes; the programme fails; the performer gets lost in the code; or the prescribed performance duration is over.Live coding is therefore the practice of writing and manipulating algorithms by programming (writing code) in front of an audience, and thereby exposing that audience to the effects of the code, which usually (but not always) takes the form of an audio-visual output: music, sound art, visuals, poetry, or dance, for example. Live coding is neither a form nor style of music; it is an audio-visual practice that draws extensively on many forms and styles of music. Live coding is also a thought-experiment with various side-effects, some of which can be framed as music.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Briones","given":"Alejandro Franco"}],"citation-key":"brionesLiveCodingTheatre2022","container-title":"Music and Time: Psychology, Philosophy, Practice","DOI":"10.1017/9781800105805.008","editor":[{"family":"Sergeant","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Michelle"}],"ISBN":"978-1-80010-580-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"112-126","publisher":"Boydell & Brewer","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Live Coding as a Theatre of Agency and a Factory of Time","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/music-and-time/live-coding-as-a-theatre-of-agency-and-a-factory-of-time/D321D1771B477B04354B10F9EA4C57F2"},

  {"id":"chafeEffectTemporalSeparation2010","abstract":"A variety of short time delays inserted between pairs of subjects were found to affect their ability to synchronize a musical task. The subjects performed a clapping rhythm together from separate sound-isolated rooms via headphones and without visual contact. One-way time delays between pairs were manipulated electronically in the range of 3 to 78 ms. We are interested in quantifying the envelope of time delay within which two individuals produce synchronous performances. The results indicate that there are distinct regimes of mutually coupled behavior, and that `natural time delay'ödelay within the narrow range associated with travel times across spatial arrangements of groups and ensembles ösupports the most stable performance. Conditions outside of this envelope, with time delays both below and above it, create characteristic interaction dynamics in the mutually coupled actions of the duo. Trials at extremely short delays (corresponding to unnaturally close proximity) had a tendency to accelerate from anticipation. Synchronization lagged at longer delays (larger than usual physical distances) and produced an increasingly severe deceleration and then deterioration of performed rhythms. The study has implications for music collaboration over the Internet and suggests that stable rhythmic performance can be achieved by `wired ensembles' across distances of thousands of kilometers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chafe","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Cáceres","given":"Juan-Pablo"},{"family":"Gurevich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"chafeEffectTemporalSeparation2010","container-title":"Perception","container-title-short":"Perception","DOI":"10.1068/p6465","ISSN":"0301-0066, 1468-4233","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"language":"en","page":"982-992","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of Temporal Separation on Synchronization in Rhythmic Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/p6465","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"eglashAutomationArtisanalEconomy2019","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to eliminate millions of jobs, from finance to truck driving. But artisanal products—(e.g. handmade textiles) are valued precisely because of their human origins, and thus have some inherent “immunity” from AI job loss. At the same time, artisanal labor, combined with technology, could potentially help to democratize the economy, allowing independent, small scale businesses to flourish. Could AI, robotics and related automation technologies enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of these beloved crafting professions, perhaps even expanding their niche to replace some job loss in other sectors? In this paper we compare the problems created by the current mass production economy, and potential solutions from an artisanal economy. In doing so, the paper details the possibilities of utilizing AI to support hybrid forms of human-machine production at the micro-scale; localized and sustainable value chains at the meso-scale; and networks of these localized and sustainable producers at the macro scale. In short, a wide range of automation technologies are potentially available for facilitating and empowering an artisanal economy. Ultimately, it is our hope that this paper will facilitate a discussion on a future vision for more “generative” economic forms in which labor value, ecological value and social value can circulate without extraction or alienation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Eglash","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Robert","given":"Lionel + \"Jr\""},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Kwame"},{"family":"Lachney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Babbitt","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"eglashAutomationArtisanalEconomy2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,8]]},"language":"en_US","note":"Accepted: 2019-08-08T21:22:59Z","publisher":"AI & Society","source":"deepblue.lib.umich.edu","title":"Automation for the Artisanal Economy: Enhancing the Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Crafting Professions with Human-Machine Collaboration","title-short":"Automation for the Artisanal Economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/150492"},

  {"id":"fosterDiscreteInternalPattern1979","abstract":"A scheme is proposed that relates the internal representation of pattern stimuli to visual pattern discrimination performance. The main assumptions of the scheme are: (1) internal representations are assigned to patterns probabilistically; (2) internal representations are discrete; (3) visual discriminability of two patterns is determined by the differences in the assignment probabilities of their internal representations. It is suggested that the internal representations associated with a pattern may be analyzed by measuring the visual detectability of small changes in pattern shape at points along a continuum of shapes. This continuum is generated by a group of transformations smoothly parameterized by a single variable. In two experiments designed to test this approach, subjects discriminated pattern displays containing combinations of three-dot subpatterns. Under the hypothesis that there were just two relevant internal representations, specifying dot collinearity and dot noncollinearity, the qualitative characteristics of the discrimination performance were correctly predicted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"David H."}],"citation-key":"fosterDiscreteInternalPattern1979","container-title":"Perception & Psychophysics","container-title-short":"Perception & Psychophysics","DOI":"10.3758/BF03204285","ISSN":"1532-5962","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"459-468","source":"Springer Link","title":"Discrete internal pattern representations and visual detection of small changes in pattern shape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03204285","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"hamiltonAestheticsImperfectionMusic2021","abstract":"The aesthetics of imperfection emphasises spontaneity, disruption, process and energy over formal perfection and is often ignored by many commentators or seen only in improvisation. This comprehensive collection is the first time imperfection has been explored across all kinds of musical performance, whether improvisation or interpretation of compositions.\n            Covering music, visual art, dance, comedy, architecture and design, it addresses the meaning, experience, and value of improvisation and spontaneous creation across different artistic media. A distinctive feature of the volume is that it brings together contributions from theoreticians and practitioners, presenting a wider range of perspectives on the issues involved. Contributors look at performance and practice across Western and non-Western musical, artistic and craft forms. Composers and non-performing artists offer a perspective on what is ‘imperfect’ or improvisatory within their work, contributing further dimensions to the discourse.\n            The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts features 39 chapters organised into eight sections and written by a diverse group of scholars and performers. They consider divergent definitions of aesthetics, employing both 18th-century philosophy and more recent socially and historically situated conceptions making this an essential, up-to-date resource for anyone working on either side of the perfection-imperfection debate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"citation-key":"hamiltonAestheticsImperfectionMusic2021","DOI":"10.5040/9781350106086","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Lara"}],"ISBN":"978-1-350-10608-6 978-1-350-10605-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing Plc","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts: Spontaneity, Flaws and the Unfinished","title-short":"The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts","type":"book","URL":"https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/the-aesthetics-of-imperfection-in-music-and-the-arts-spontaneity-flaws-and-the-unfinished"},

Our research team has been working on the construction of a common morphokinetic alphabet (CMA) for the systematic observation of daily life activities. The project, which was launched several years ago, was designed to create a system for describing and analyzing body motion expression, physical activity, and physical appearance. In this paper, we describe an idiosyncratic application of Noam Chomsky’s phrase marker grammar to the morphokinetic phrase, the objective being to establish the grammatical rules and basic order of the symbol string according to a relational tree formed by the breakdown of the syntactic components identified as structuring the visual description of movement.

  {"id":"keoghMentalImageryVisual2011","abstract":"Visual working memory provides an essential link between past and future events. Despite recent efforts, capacity limits, their genesis and the underlying neural structures of visual working memory remain unclear. Here we show that performance in visual working memory - but not iconic visual memory - can be predicted by the strength of mental imagery as assessed with binocular rivalry in a given individual. In addition, for individuals with strong imagery, modulating the background luminance diminished performance on visual working memory and imagery tasks, but not working memory for number strings. This suggests that luminance signals were disrupting sensory-based imagery mechanisms and not a general working memory system. Individuals with poor imagery still performed above chance in the visual working memory task, but their performance was not affected by the background luminance, suggesting a dichotomy in strategies for visual working memory: individuals with strong mental imagery rely on sensory-based imagery to support mnemonic performance, while those with poor imagery rely on different strategies. These findings could help reconcile current controversy regarding the mechanism and location of visual mnemonic storage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Keogh","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Joel"}],"citation-key":"keoghMentalImageryVisual2011","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0029221","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,14]]},"language":"en","page":"e29221","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Mental Imagery and Visual Working Memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029221","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"kirkbrideCollaborativeInterfacesEnsemble2020","abstract":"This research is a practice-led investigation into collaborative user interfaces within the practice of live coding; the act of writing computer code for generating improvised music live in front of an audience. It examines the impact of user interface design parameters on group creativity and explores the roles of data, text, and programming languages as media for musical communication. Utilising a multi-faceted research method that combines iterative “participatory design” (Spinuzzi, 2005) with performance-led “research in the wild” (Benford et al., 2013), this research couples ethnographic and autoethnographic observations to gain insight into the practice of ensemble live coding and inform software design. Three novel collaborative interfaces have been developed as part of this research that explore various facets of musical collaboration in live coding. Each interface was developed through an iterative and reflexive methodology focused on user-centred design and was employed in a cyclical process of artistic practice and refinement based on user evaluation and in-depth study. The first interface, entitled Troop, is a shared text editor that allows multiple performers to collaborate on the same single body of code together. The second, CodeBank, explores how private working in a collaborative context affects creativity and improvisation. Finally, PolyGlot, combines multiple live coding languages into a single collaborative interface that enables live coding musicians to play together, regardless of their knowledge of languages. As well as these three graphical interfaces, the functionality of an existing live coding language, FoxDot, was extended to help facilitate the sharing of musical information within an ensemble. Each interface was used in live performance by The Yorkshire Programming Ensemble and evaluated through group interview sessions that examined the themes of immediacy, trust, and risk with regards to both human-computer interaction and intra-ensemble communication as well as the experience of personal- and group-flow states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirkbride","given":"Ryan Philip"}],"citation-key":"kirkbrideCollaborativeInterfacesEnsemble2020","DOI":"10/ch6_1a-Rehearsal-26_04_17.mpg","genre":"phd","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"cc_by_nc_sa_4","publisher":"University of Leeds","source":"etheses.whiterose.ac.uk","title":"Collaborative interfaces for ensemble live coding performance","type":"thesis","URL":"https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28901/"},

This comprehensive collection is the first time imperfection has been explored across all kinds of musical performance, whether improvisation or interpretation of compositions.\n            Covering music, visual art, dance, comedy, architecture and design, it addresses the meaning, experience, and value of improvisation and spontaneous creation across different artistic media. A distinctive feature of the volume is that it brings together contributions from theoreticians and practitioners, presenting a wider range of perspectives on the issues involved. Contributors look at performance and practice across Western and non-Western musical, artistic and craft forms. Composers and non-performing artists offer a perspective on what is ‘imperfect’ or improvisatory within their work, contributing further dimensions to the discourse.\n            The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts features 39 chapters organised into eight sections and written by a diverse group of scholars and performers. They consider divergent definitions of aesthetics, employing both 18th-century philosophy and more recent socially and historically situated conceptions making this an essential, up-to-date resource for anyone working on either side of the perfection-imperfection debate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Knotts","given":"Shelly"}],"citation-key":"knottsLiveCodingFailure2021","container-title":"The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts: Spontaneity, Flaws and the Unfinished","DOI":"10.5040/9781350106086","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Lara"}],"ISBN":"978-1-350-10608-6 978-1-350-10605-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing Plc","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Live coding and failure","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/the-aesthetics-of-imperfection-in-music-and-the-arts-spontaneity-flaws-and-the-unfinished"},

  {"id":"koDeconstructingCSCulture2021","abstract":"This is an invited keynote I gave at the 2021 IEEE RESPECT conference, which focuses on equity, inclusion and justice in computing and computing education. In it, I share my own complicated experiences in CS, and relate them to those of others who we often describe as in dominant groups, trying to surface their unique forms of marginalization. I argue that CS is a refuge for dominant groups, show how that refuge is defined by social segregation, and then complicate broadening participation efforts by showing how uprooting that culture of segregation poses psychological and intellectual threats to dominant groups who are marginalized in their own ways.\n\nHere is the abstract for the talk:\n\nModern computing culture is unquestionably exclusionary. In education, students who are Black, Hispanic, women, women, gender non-conforming, disabled, or divergent in many other way from the dominant groups in computing often face structural barriers, microaggressions, and disregard. And in industry, these same problems perpetuate, not only shaping the culture of computing companies, but also their products, services, policies, and politics. The question is no longer whether exclusion occurs, but why. Many powerful explanations of these dynamics look to white supremacy, sexism, ableism, and capitalism, linking computing culture to the broader matrix of domination in society. In this talk, however, I want to consider an additional factor at play: the central role of social segregation in computing culture and how such segregation offers psychological safety to its dominant groups, who are in some ways marginalized themselves in society more broadly. By deconstructing these dynamics, and demonstrating how they interact with other systems of oppression to produce marginalization, I hope to map the significant challenges we face in reimagining a computing culture that is truly inclusive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ko","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"koDeconstructingCSCulture2021","genre":"Keynote","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,22]]},"title":"Deconstructing CS Culture – Dr. Amy J.

Participants freely chose which of two images to imagine. Using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we decoded imagery content as far as 11 seconds before the voluntary decision, in visual, frontal and subcortical areas. Decoding in visual areas in addition to perception-imagery generalization suggested that predictive patterns correspond to visual representations. Importantly, activity patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1) from before the decision, predicted future imagery vividness.

In two experiments, one array contained only relatively narrow (highresolution) stripes, and one contained only relatively thick (low-resolution) stripes. The subjects compared sets of stripes in different quadrants according to their length, spacing, orientation, or width. When the subjects visualized the arrays, they required much more time to compare high-resolution patterns than low-resolution patterns; when the subjects saw the arrays, they evaluated both types of arrays equally easily. In addition, the results from the third experiment provide strong evidence that people use imagery in this task; in one condition, the subjects evaluated oblique sets of stripes, and in another condition, they evaluated vertical and horizontal stripes. In both imagery and perception, the subjects made more errors when evaluating oblique stimuli; in imagery, they also required more time to evaluate oblique stimuli. The results suggest that additional effort is required in imagery to represent visual patterns with high resolution. This finding demonstrates that, although imagery and perception may activate common brain regions, it is more difficult to represent high-resolution information in imagery than in perception.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kosslyn","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Sukel","given":"Katherine E."},{"family":"Bly","given":"Benjamin Martin"}],"citation-key":"kosslynSquintingMindEye1999","container-title":"Memory & Cognition","container-title-short":"Memory & Cognition","DOI":"10.3758/BF03211412","ISSN":"1532-5946","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"276-287","source":"Springer Link","title":"Squinting with the mind’s eye: Effects of stimulus resolution on imaginal and perceptual comparisons","title-short":"Squinting with the mind’s eye","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03211412","volume":"27"},

Taking nothing for granted and addressing diverse readers from Karnatik music's rich spectrum and beyond it, Krishna provides a path-breaking overview of south Indian classical music. He advances provocative ideas about various aspects of its practice. Central to his thinking is the concept of 'art music', the ability to achieve abstraction, as the foundational character of Karnatik music. In his explorations, he sights the visible connections and unappreciated intersections between this music form and others - Hindustani music, Bharatanatyam, fusion music and cine music - treading new, often contentious, ground. A Southern Music seeks to retrace the sources of Karnatik music even as it reflects on its self-renewing vitality today. To that end, Krishna examines a number of issues that Karnatik music must face up to: questions of gender and caste, the role of religion and of lyrics inspired by devotional sentiments, the diaspora and its relationship with 'classical' music, technology.

  {"id":"laskyAbilitySixYearOldsEightYearOlds1974","abstract":"The abstractive and integrative abilities of 6-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and adults were investigated by a paradigm developed by Franks and Bransford (1971). A series of visual stimulus patterns were presented during the acquisition phase of the experiment. The Ss were required to reproduce these stimulus patterns but were not told that they would be required to recognize them later. The Ss were then given a recognition test.

  {"id":"lewisIndigenousProtocolArtificial2020","abstract":"This position paper on Indigenous Protocol (IP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a starting place for those who want to design and create AI from an ethical position that centers Indigenous concerns. Each Indigenous community will have its own particular approach to the questions we raise in what follows. What we have written here is not a substitute for establishing and maintaining relationships of reciprocal care and support with specific Indigenous communities. Rather, this document offers a range of ideas to take into consideration when entering into conversations which prioritize Indigenous perspectives in the development of artificial intelligence. It captures multiple layers of a discussion that happened over 20 months, across 20 time zones, during two workshops, and between Indigenous people (and a few non-Indigenous folks) from diverse communities in Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific.  \n\nIndigenous ways of knowing are rooted in distinct, sovereign territories across the planet. These extremely diverse landscapes and histories have influenced different communities and their discrete cultural protocols over time. A single ‘Indigenous perspective’ does not exist, as epistemologies are motivated and shaped by the grounding of specific communities in particular territories. Historically, scholarly traditions that homogenize diverse Indigenous cultural practices have resulted in ontological and epistemological violence, and a flattening of the rich texture and variability of Indigenous thought. Our aim is to articulate a multiplicity of Indigenous knowledge systems and technological practices that can and should be brought to bear on the ‘question of AI.’\n \nTo that end, rather than being a unified statement this position paper is a collection of heterogeneous texts that range from design guidelines to scholarly essays to artworks to descriptions of technology prototypes to poetry. We feel such a somewhat multivocal and unruly format more accurately reflects the fact that this conversation is very much in an incipient stage as well as keeps the reader aware of the range of viewpoints expressed in the workshops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"Jason Edward"},{"family":"Abdilla","given":"Angie"},{"family":"Arista","given":"Noelani"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Kaipulaumakaniolono"},{"family":"Benesiinaabandan","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Meredith"},{"family":"Cordes","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Davison","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Kūpono"},{"family":"Garzon","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Harrell","given":"D.

  {"id":"lozanoCriticalSubjectivityAlgorave2022","abstract":"Algorave is a global community dedicated to expanding the boundaries of algorithms and coding in the context of live electronic music. Through algorithms, Algorave members have discovered the power of altering music’s structure. In the face of a fully automated future, this article queries whether this power may be directed towards defying political, economic, ideological, or ethical systems. First, I present Algorave as an idiosyncratic environment of a post-work society. Second, I develop a critique of Kathi Weeks’ handling of the concept of subjectivity to question a post-work imaginary that comprises the subject. Third, I explain the pertinence of a critical subjectivity praxis for Algorave to enrich their post-work stance, whereby I suggest using their analytical lens on algorithms to prevent subjectivity from passing on to the post-human terrain. From here, I conclude that the subject of automation is the automated subject, and that a post-work society is not possible without overthrowing subjectivity. I ultimately caution the advocates of automation when pursuing post-work, for if automation manages to make subjectivity a part of algorithms with governmental impact, we will be—now and for good—automatically condemned to living as subjects, significantly reinforcing the basis of neoliberal work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lozano","given":"Camilo Andrés Hoyos"}],"citation-key":"lozanoCriticalSubjectivityAlgorave2022","container-title":"New Sociology: Journal of Critical Praxis","DOI":"10.25071/2563-3694.40","ISSN":"2563-3694","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 New Sociology: Journal of Critical Praxis","source":"nsjcp.journals.yorku.ca","title":"Critical Subjectivity in Algorave’s Post-Work Practices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nsjcp.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/default/article/view/40","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"luthfiOpenDataEvidencebased2019","abstract":"Over the last decade, more and more data are collected and opened. Governments actively stimulate the opening of data to increase citizen engagement to support policy-making processes. Evidence-based policy-making is the situation whereby decisions made are based on factual data. The common expectation is that releasing data will result in evidence-based decision-making and more trust in government decisions. This study aims to provide insight into how evidence-based policy based on open data can result into uncertainty and even polarize the policy-making process. We analyze a case study in which traffic and road utilization datasets are used and model the decision-making process using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The BPMN model shows how the government and business organizations can use the data and give different interpretations. Data-driven decision-making might potentially create uncertainty, polarization, and less trust in decisions as stakeholders can give different meanings to the data and arrive at different outcomes. In contrast to the common belief, we found that the more data released, the more discussions happened about what is desired according to the data. The various directions derived from the data can even polarize decision-making. In other words, the more data opened, the more people can construct their perception of reality. For further research, we recommend understanding the types and role of data to create an evidence-based approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Luthfi","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Janssen","given":"Marijn"}],"citation-key":"luthfiOpenDataEvidencebased2019","container-title":"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology","DOI":"10.18517/ijaseit.9.3.8846","ISSN":"2460-6952","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,30]]},"language":"en","license":"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:     Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

  {"id":"mooreHomininStoneFlaking2020","abstract":"The philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that complex structures in the natural and cultural worlds emerge from two types of design. Bottom-up design involves the rote action of a simple algorithm in an environment constrained by physical laws. Top-down design involves deliberation and planning, and is unique to modern humans. Identifying the emergence of top-down design in the hominin lineage is an important research challenge, and the archaeological record of stone technology is our best evidence for it. A current view is that artefact types and flaking methods increased in complexity from 3.3 to c. 0.3 million years ago, reflecting improving capacities at spatial cognition and working memory, culminating in top-down design perhaps as early as 1.75 million years ago. Recent experimental work, however, has shown that a simple ‘remove flake’ algorithm constrained by the laws of fracture mechanics—a form of bottom-up design—can produce stone tool attributes thought to be evidence of top-down design. Here, these models are reviewed and critiqued in light of the new experimental evidence. A revised working memory-based model, focusing on the recursive aspects of stone flaking, is proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Mark W."}],"citation-key":"mooreHomininStoneFlaking2020","container-title":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","DOI":"10.1017/s0959774320000190","ISSN":"0959-7743, 1474-0540","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"647-664","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Hominin Stone Flaking and the Emergence of ‘Top-down’ Design in Human Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/abs/hominin-stone-flaking-and-the-emergence-of-topdown-design-in-human-evolution/A9FC6880A51EE78FAD8558560A382B59#","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"muellerBreakingThingsWork2021","abstract":"In the 19th century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new tecnologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years 'the Luddites' roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and maneuvers that they would later deploy on unassuming machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of of the antagonistic relationship between workers - all workers, including us today - and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The luddites weren't primitive or even anachronistic - they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the 21st century world. Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labor and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is high, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the Neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology.","author":[{"family":"Mueller","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"muellerBreakingThingsWork2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,9]]},"source":"Amazon","title":"Breaking Things at Work: The Luddites Are Right About Why You Hate Your Job","title-short":"Breaking Things at Work","type":"book"},

Navajo women workers were described as ideal predigital digital workers, uniquely suited to the job by temperament, culture, and gender.

  {"id":"narmourAnalysisCognitionBasic1990","abstract":"Eugene Narmour formulates a comprehensive theory of melodic syntax to explain cognitive relations between melodic tones at their most basic level. Expanding on the theories of Leonard B. Meyer, the author develops one parsimonious, scaled set of rules modeling implication and realization in all the primary parameters of music. Through an elaborate and original analytic symbology, he shows that a kind of \"genetic code\" governs the perception and cognition of melody. One is an automatic, \"brute\" system operating on stylistic primitives from the bottom up. The other constitutes a learned system of schemata impinging on style structures from the top down. The theoretical constants Narmour uses are context-free and, therefore, applicable to all styles of melody. He places considerable emphasis on the listener's cognitive performance (that is, fundamental melodic perception as opposed to acquired musical competence). He concentrates almost exclusively on low-level, note-to-note relations. The result is a highly generalized theory useful in researching all manner of psychological and music-theoretic problems concerned with the analysis and cognition of melody. \"In this innovative, landmark book, a distinguished music theorist draws extensively from a variety of disciplines, in particular from cognitive psychology and music theory, to develop an elegant and persuasive framework for the understanding of melody.

  {"id":"oakCraftQueerEcology2020","abstract":"HAND weaving exists as a complex mesh of inter-relationships between people, communities, and nature. It is, like ecology, a study in dynamics. The assertion that handcrafted, human-powered production not only exists, but can flourish and even meet the future needs of communities sustainably is the basis of this paper. What we argue against is the dominant rhetoric of Indian handloom weavers’ practice that is labelled either as aesthetic cultural goods, authentic heritage and exclusive hobby craft, or as outdated production, inefficient work and unskilled labour. The handloom weaver constantly encounters this rhetoric in society (the market and in policy spheres) presented as a series of dualities that she is forced to choose between, in ways that systematically diminish her reality.\n\nWhat do we mean by binaries in craft? In this paper, we examine three of the more common ones: artist or artisan, authentic or fake, and work or leisure. Some others of significance are: profession or caste, text or orality, tacit or explicit, fine or coarse, knowledge or skill. We find that, without exception, they originate in essentialist ideas of knowledge, identity and craft.\n\nAny selection among these binaries imposes constraints on the weaver’s way of knowing and being, and her ability to sustain her practice. The political and market categories that emerge from these binaries – schemes, certifications, awards, labels, and tags – are in active denial of the complexity of the weaver’s ecology. Some of these labels perpetrate violence on the community by only allowing them to define their work in terms of what it’s not. Given that the weaver’s practice is centred on her body, how then can she negotiate with society in other ways? Particularly, what kind of epistemology would support her reality? We recognize that in theories of embodied knowledge there already exists a body of work that rejects principles of Cartesian dualism. In this exploratory essay, drawing on lessons from queer ecology, we study other ways of engaging with bodies and nature that constantly question these constructed binaries, and offer exciting new possibilities that can help subvert them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Oak","given":"Vivek S"},{"family":"Mamidipudi","given":"V.

The dance, the The Machinery, traceable to the1820s, is striking as possibly the earliest example of the creative expression of alienation and dehumanization in the industrial workspace.

Taking the steps of the early nineteenth-century clog dance, they re-contextualised its history, using it to control a machine of the twenty-first century, the digital computer. Thus, the performers - dancer and computer operator - work together to create an intermedial space where the real world, occupied by the human worker, and virtual world of the machine are coupled to each other and acting in equal partnership.

Subjects made fast, but inaccurate, responses in the perception task when RT s were recorded, but the error rate declined substantially when they were given 10 sec to make a decision. In the latter condition, subjects failed to detect a part on 14% of the trials in the perception condition and on 72% of the trials in the imagery condition when a correction was made for prior perception of the part. A subsequent experiment showed that the high error rate in the imagery task was not the result of the subject’s inability to remember the complete pattern.

Strudel is an attempt to make live coding more accessible, by creating a system that runs entirely in the browser, while opening Tidals approach to algorithmic patterns (Mclean 2020) up to modern audio/visual web technologies. The Strudel REPL is a live code editor dedicated to manipulating Strudel patterns while they play, with builtin visual feedback. While Strudel is written in JavaScript, the API is optimized for simplicity and readability by applying code transformations on the syntax tree level, allowing language operations that would otherwise be impossible. The application supports multiple ways to output sound, including Tone.js, Web Audio nodes, OSC (Open Sound Control) messages, Web Serial andWeb MIDI. The project is split into multiple packages, allowing granular reuse in other applications. Apart from TidalCycles, Strudel draws inspiration from many prior existing projects like TidalVortex (McLean et al. 2022), Gibber (Roberts and Kuchera-morin 2012), Estuary (Ogborn et al. 2017), Hydra (Jack [2022] 2022), Ocarina (Solomon [2021] 2022) and Feedforward (McLean 2020).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Roos","given":"Felix"},{"family":"McLean","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"roosStrudelAlgorithmicPatterns2022","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.6821023","event-place":"Cannes, France","event-title":"Web Audio Conference","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"publisher":"Zenodo","publisher-place":"Cannes, France","title":"Strudel: Algorithmic Patterns for the Web","title-short":"Strudel","type":"speech","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/6821023"},

Generated patterns are enacted and interpreted by the human who stitches the ﬁnal product, following a long and laborious, yet entertaining and leisurely, process of stitching and sewing. The blending of digital and physical spaces, the tension between machine and human authorship, and the juxtaposition of stereotypically masculine computing with highly feminine textile crafts, leads to the opportunity for new kinds of tools, experiences, and artworks. This paper argues for the values of textiles as a domain for generative methods research, and discusses generalizable research problems that are highlighted through operating in this new domain.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Gillian"}],"citation-key":"smithGenerativeDesignTextiles","DOI":"10.1609/aiide.v13i1.12925","language":"en","page":"7","source":"Zotero","title":"Generative Design for Textiles: Opportunities and Challenges for Entertainment AI","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"stancinDanceTempoEstimation2021","abstract":"We present a methodology that enables dance tempo estimation through the acquisition of 3D accelerometer signals using a single wearable inertial device positioned on the dancer’s leg. Our tempo estimation method is based on enhanced multiple resonators, implemented with comb feedback filters. To validate the methodology, we focus on the versatile solo jazz dance style. Including a variety of dance moves, with different leg activation patterns and rhythmical variations, solo jazz provides for a highly critical validation environment. We consider 15 different solo jazz dance moves, with different leg activation patterns, assembled in a sequence of 5 repetitions of each, giving 65 moves altogether. A professional and a recreational dancer performed this assembly in a controlled environment, following eight dancing tempos, dictated by a metronome, and ranging from 80 bpm to 220 bpm with 20 bpm increment steps. We show that with appropriate enhancements and using single leg signals, the comb filter bank provides for accurate dance tempo estimates for all moves and rhythmical variations considered. Dance tempo estimates for the overall assembles match strongly the dictated tempo—the difference being at most 1 bpm for all measurement instances is within the limits of the established beat onset stability of the used metronome. Results further show that this accuracy is achievable for shorter dancing excerpts, comprising four dance moves, corresponding to one music phrase, and as such enables real-time feedback. By providing for a dancer’s tempo quality and consistency assessment, the presented methodology has the potential of supporting the learning process, classifying individual level of experience, and assessing overall performance. It is extendable to other dance styles and sport motion in general where cyclical patterns occur.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Stančin","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Tomažič","given":"Sašo"}],"citation-key":"stancinDanceTempoEstimation2021","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s21238066","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"23","page":"8066","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Dance Tempo Estimation Using a Single Leg-Attached 3D Accelerometer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/8066","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"VisuospatialWorkingMemory2014","abstract":"Representation of the visual and spatial properties of our environment is a pivotal requirement of everyday cognition. We can mentally represent the visual form of objects. We can extract information from several of the senses as to the location of objects in relation to ourselves and to other objects nearby. For some of those objects we can reach out and manipulate them. We can also imagine ourselves manipulating objects in advance of doing so, or even when it would be impossible to do so physically. The problem posed to science is how these cognitive operations are accomplished, and proffered accounts lie in two essentially parallel research endeavours, working memory and imagery. Working memory is thought to pervade everyday cognition, to provide on-line processing and temporary storage, and to update, moment to moment, our representation of the current state of our environment and our interactions with that environment. There is now a strong case for the claims of working memory in the area of phonological and articulatory functions, all of which appear to contribute to everyday activities such as counting, arithmetic, vocabulary acquisition, and some aspects of reading and language comprehension. The claims for visual and spatial working memory functions are less convincing. Most notable has been the assumption that visual and spatial working memory are intimately involved in the generation, retention and manipulations of visual images. There has until recently been little hard evidence to justify that assumption, and the research on visual and spatial working memory has focused on a relatively restricted range of imagery tasks and phenomena. In a more or less independent development, the literature on visual imagery has now amassed a voluminous corpus of data and theory about a wide range of imagery phenomena. Despite this, few books on imagery refer to the concept of working memory in any detail, or specify the nature of the working memory system that might be involved in mental imagery. This essay follows a line of reconciliation and positive critiquing in exploring the possible overlap between mental imagery and working memory. Theoretical development in the book draws on data from both cognitive psychology and cognitive neuropsychology. The aim is to stimulate debate, to address directly a number of assumptions that hitherto have been implicit, and to assess the contribution of the concept of working memory to our understanding of these intriguing core aspects of human cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"citation-key":"VisuospatialWorkingMemory2014","DOI":"10.4324/9781315804743","ISBN":"978-1-315-80474-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,18]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Psychology Press","source":"www.taylorfrancis.com","title":"Visuo-spatial Working Memory","type":"book","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315804743/visuo-spatial-working-memory-robert-logie"},

  {"id":"washburnSymmetryComesAge2004","abstract":"This is the companion volume to the authors' groundbreaking Symmetries of Culture, the classic reference for symmetry analysis of pattern for anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, mathematicians, and designers. Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world.The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture's fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphorsembedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.","author":[{"family":"Washburn","given":"Washburn","suffix":"Dorothy Koster"},{"family":"Washburn","given":"Dorothy Koster"},{"family":"Crowe","given":"Donald W."},{"family":"Crowe","given":"Donald Warren"}],"citation-key":"washburnSymmetryComesAge2004","ISBN":"978-0-295-98366-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"University of Washington Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Symmetry Comes of Age: The Role of Pattern in Culture","title-short":"Symmetry Comes of Age","type":"book"},

  {"id":"yorkSlingsSlingstonesForgotton2011","abstract":"&lt;p&gt;For most of us, our knowledge of slings and slingstones begins and ends with the biblical tale of David slaying Goliath. Scholars and archaeologists have told us that slings like the one David employed were common in the Old World, used not just for shepherd boys to kill giants but for protecting herds, hunting, and combat. However, few scholars have addressed the function slings have occupied outside of Eurasian civilizations, especially their use in Oceania and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this astounding new archaeological survey, authors Robert York and Gigi York examine the history of Oceania and the Americas to unveil the significant role slings and slingstones played in developing societies. They present new evidence that suggests that unlike David who plucked rounded pebbles from a stream, inhabitants of the Pacific Islands deliberately fashioned sling missiles out of coral, stone, and clay into uniquely deadly shapes. They also show that the use of slings in the Americas was more pervasive and inclined to variability than previously recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well documented, bountifully illustrated, and thoroughly researched, &lt;i&gt;Slings and Slingstones&lt;/i&gt; is sure to engage readers interested in expanding their knowledge of the past.

  {"id":"youngEternalPulseCreating2017","abstract":"This research examines the use of konnakkol in the creative musical practice of select contemporary artists, resulting in the creation and performance of a new composition for jazz quartet, and demonstrating how the konnakkol art form continues to evolve and be adapted on the world stage. Commonly described as a sophisticated style of vocal percussion, konnakkol is the performance art form of the intoned rhythmic recitation of solkattu, the vocalised rhythmic syllables of South Indian classical music and dance. My ethnomusicological field research finds that as a musician’s companion, the Carnatic system of solkattu/konnakkol has a broad range of practical and creative functions. In-depth interviews with konnakkol artists Kaaraikkudi Mani (India), Suresh Vaidyanathan (India) and Lori Cotler (USA) provide insight into the way these musicians work creatively with konnakkol in traditional and cross-cultural projects. The research demonstrates how artists fluent in konnakkol move beyond its pedagogical role to employ its use as a highly creative tool, in which konnakkol provides a conceptual framework for metred numerical calculations, improvisation, composition, rhythmic comprehension and analysis, transference of musical ideas, and expression of musical pulse. It also demonstrates the use of atypical konnakkol syllables, along with timbral and pitch variations in contemporary konnakkol delivery. For this research I created and performed the song cycle The Eternal Pulse with jazz musicians Ben Robertson, Stephen Magnusson and Dave Beck. In composing this work, I explored the expression of ‘eternal’ and ‘internal’ pulse, understood as the musical metre and the internal sub-divisions of the metre respectively. I used intoned and pitched konnakkol as a fully integrated vocal and musical expression in a Western contemporary jazz context, embedding konnakkol and wordless lingual sounds within this format to create a unique ‘vocal sound-bank’ as the basis for my vocal expression. This style of pitched konnakkol is a distinctive feature of my creative practice. In this process, The Eternal Pulse created a new style of composition and performance by integrating konnakkol language and concepts as melodies, riffs and the language for improvised passages. The Eternal Pulse, the related reflective analysis, and the insights drawn from fieldwork interviews all demonstrate the adaptive and evolving use of konnakkol in contemporary performance practice. The resultant new knowledge is a documented articulation of a practitioner’s perspective acquired by taking the tradition of konnakkol into a Western creative context. This also represents a contribution to the knowledge of broader practical and creative applications of konnakkol in contemporary performance practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"youngEternalPulseCreating2017","DOI":"10.4225/03/58b3b6b2049f1","genre":"thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,27]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Monash University","source":"bridges.monash.edu","title":"The Eternal Pulse: creating with konnakkol and its adaptation into contemporary vocal performance","title-short":"The Eternal Pulse","type":"thesis","URL":"https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/The_Eternal_Pulse_creating_with_konnakkol_and_its_adaptation_into_contemporary_vocal_performance/4697335/1"},
